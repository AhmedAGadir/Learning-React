in class based syntax render is the only method thats required 

you can just use the CDN from the reactdocs in your index.html to use react
alternatively you could set up your own thing like webpack/gulp 
the easiest way if definitely the create-react-app way.

// to get it ready for production - write "npm run build" in the terminal, this will compile everything which can then be uploaded to your server.
