$ npm run dev

// nextjs pre-renders the content we load as pages on the server with automatic code-splitting/lazy loading sothat google crawlers can do SEO with our page

$ npm init

$ npm install --save react react-dom nextjs 

// we dont use react-router with nextjs, instead a use a folder and file structure to reflect our URL in the file system.

// cant use css modules in nextjs, however nextjs offers its own way of doing it (See User component)

// for deployement you need to deploy the entire project folder (because you need to install the node_modules folder)
// note: you need a host thats able to run node.js as nextjs uses and only runs on node.js (e.g. AWS elastic beanstalk or Heroku)
// after shipping the entire project then run the following on your server:
$ npm install
$ npm start 
(npm start is different than in create-react-app -- see package.json)
// then the project will be running on the server
