in class based syntax render is the only method thats required 

you can just use the CDN from the reactdocs in your index.html to use react
alternatively you could set up your own thing like webpack/gulp 
the easiest way if definitely the create-react-app way.

// to get it ready for production - write "npm run build" in the terminal, this will compile everything which can then be uploaded to your server.



// SEE ADDPROJECT.JS
// you can access elements and components in your code by passing them refernces and then using this.refs.whateverYouNamedTheReference
// this is the easiest way to bind the this operator (<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}> )
// notice => this.setState can also take a second parameter which is a callback function 
// could be useful => (static defaultProps)



// NPM module called UUID -> generates unqiue ID's - use "npm install --save uuid" then "import uuid from 'uuid'""
